# Functions on collections

There are a number of functions that can be performed on collections that allow you to effectively loop over collections.

These include the following:

## Lists

### Iterators

`array.foreach(expression)`

Returns an array where `value` and `index` are used as keywords

### Reducers

`array.min()`, `array.max()`, `array.average()`

`array.where()`

`array.select()`

## Dictionaries

### Iterators

`dictionary.foreach(expression)`

> [!NOTE] Add ability to iterate in a goal-seek like fashion using dictionaries
