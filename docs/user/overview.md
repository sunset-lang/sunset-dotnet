# Overview

This page provides an overview of the Sunset calculation framework. This framework was created to handle:

- [Unit checking and conversions](./units.md)
- [Calculations involving quantities](./quantities.md)
- [Reporting](./reporting.md)
- [Design of elements](./design-framework.md)

In addition to the base framework, the [**Sunset Language**](./Common.Sunset.Language/language-description.md) has been created as a simple way of expressing design calculations.
