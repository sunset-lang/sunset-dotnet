# Introduction

This interactive tutorial will get you started with the Sunset programming language even if you have never written a
single line of code in your life. It will walk you through all the steps from writing your first line of code to
creating a small application.

All you need is a basic understanding of arithmetic and algebra, and a desire to learn
something new.

## Prologue

The year is 1280, and the castle that you live in has a problem. You're the person that designs and builds the castle's
defensive machinery (catapults, trebuchets, crossbows... that kind of thing), and the Queen's head advisor has come to
you with a problem. You're the closest thing there is to an engineer at this time, but that title wouldn't be invented
for another 350 years.

The season has been unusually good for the town's crops, and as a measure of gratitude the villagers have sent to the
castle more cabbages than the castle's occupants could possibly eat.

As a result, some of these cabbages have started to go bad and the smell of rotting cabbage is beginning to become
overwhelming. The advisor has tried to get rid of these cabbages, but there are just no options available.
If they are taken out of the front gates, the villagers will see them and possibly get offended.

This has led them to you. They ask politely if you could repurpose one of the city's catapults to launch a crate of
these cabbages over the city walls and the village, and into the garbage heap that lies 150 metres outside of city
grounds. You know that this is possible, but having never fired something with such accuracy before you know that this
will be a tricky task.

### The task

You'll need to calculate the exact distance that the crate will be launched. Here's what you know:

- The crate has a mass of 30 kilograms.
- The cabbages have a mass of 150 kilograms.
- The catapult that is closest to the field can apply 30 kilonewtons of force for 3 seconds to accelerate the crate as
  it launches it.

Due to the risk that this project poses, the Queen would like to review the calculations before a single cabbage is
fired. Just as you're about to tell the Queen's advisor that it's going to take a few weeks to do the calculations,
write up a report and bind it together, they hand you a book titled [The Sunset Reference Manual]. They tell you that
they found it in the castle's library and it should be able to help with the task.

You sit down at the computer which is inexplicably in your office despite it being 900 years before it was invented, and
get to work.
